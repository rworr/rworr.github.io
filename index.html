                During my work term at SAP, I researched, designed, and implemented a partially lock-free dynamic memory allocator in C++.
                I began by studying various research papers and current company code, and designed the memory allocator by incorporating ideas
                from the papers and current code, and brainstorming data structure design with my co-workers.
                I also created benchmarks to compare the current memory manager, prototype, and malloc on Windows, 
                and wrote Python code to simulate memory movement within designs using data obtained by tracing allocations in code.
                Ultimately, the final implementation showed a 10% performance increase over malloc on 64-bit systems
                and a 20-30% performance increase over malloc on 32-bit systems.
