                Ultimately, the final implementation showed a 10% performance increase over malloc on 64-bit systems
                and a 20-30% performance increase over malloc on 32-bit systems.

                My friends and I spent some time playing around with Android app development, trying
                to create a scoreboard app we could use to keep track of games we play, like FIFA or Call of Duty.
                The app isn't completed, but we explored dynamically creating UI elements, using a database in Android,
                and using a ListView with custom elements.

              More coming soon! I'm starting to explore the areas of Augmented Reality and Computer Vision, and
              hope to start working on some apps that implement some ideas, likely beginning with a real-time edge detector.

                I have completed 79 problems on ProjectEuler.net previously, but I am starting again from Problem 1 in 3 languages: C++, Java, and Python.
                Additionally, I wrote some scripts to facilitate development of Project Euler problems, including databases of known
                answers and fastest times for each language. I am posting my fastest times on github, but I will not be releasing solutions
                publicly. If you wish to see some of my solutions, please contact me directly.

                Taught by Douglas Schmidt of Vanderbilt University via Coursera.org, 
                this course looked at patterns, which are general solutions to common problems in software design, 
                and focused on the patterns used in concurrent and networked software. 
                In addition to an overview of concurrency, networking, and the associated patterns and frameworks, 
                the course also featured a look at the Android and ACE frameworks, and a look inside JAWS, an open-source web server.
